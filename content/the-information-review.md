Title: "The Information by James Gleick - a review: June 20, 2019" Date: 2019-06-20

### A brief review

One of my favourite books in recent memory. James Gleick presents information theory in an easy to digest format using the narrative stories of each of its major contributors. 

Was especially interesting to me in the context of learning Mandarin. One of the major insights of information theory I took away was that as noise in a system increases, more bits of information are required to convey the message.
